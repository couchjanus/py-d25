# Execute the code again, and see that it stops at the breakpoint,

# -> if candidate / lower == candidate // lower:
# (Pdb)

# Check the value of the candidate and the two operations. 
# This line is checking whether the dividing of candidate 
# by lower is an integer (the float and integer division is the same):
# (Pdb) candidate
# 3
# (Pdb) candidate / lower
# 1.5
# (Pdb) candidate // lower
# 1
# Continue to the next instruction with n. 
# See that it ends the while loop and returns True:
# (Pdb) n
# > ...debug.py(10)valid()
# -> lower -= 1
# (Pdb) n
# > ...debug.py(6)valid()
# -> while lower > 1:
# (Pdb) n

# > ...debug.py(12)valid()->True

# Continue the execution until another breakpoint is found with c. 
# Note that this is the next call to valid(), which has 15 as an input:
# (Pdb) c

# -> if candidate / lower == candidate // lower:
# (Pdb) candidate
# 15
# (Pdb) lower

# Continue running and inspecting the numbers until 
# what the valid function is doing makes sense. 

# When youâ€™re done, exit with q. 
# This stops the execution:
# (Pdb) q
